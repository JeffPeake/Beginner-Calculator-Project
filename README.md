# Beginner-Calculator-Project
Java calculator program, being used primarily to familiarize myself with GitHub and practice Java with a project of my own. 

My initial implementation could only handle two values in an expression, I briefly experimented with using different classes to represent expressions/operators and help with calculating answers from an infix expression (eg. 1 + 2 * 5). Following some coursework related to parsing however, I ended up discovering the shunting-yard algorithm. My implementation now can handle multiple value expressions. Possible furture extentions to my program would be allowing functions such as sin, cos, tan etc. I also would like to try implementing a GUI.
